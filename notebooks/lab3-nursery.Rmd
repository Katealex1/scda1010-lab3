This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(Amelia)
library(rattle)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(caret)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

## Nursery Data Set reference and short description

parents:     usual, pretentious, great_pret.
has_nurs:    proper, less_proper, improper, critical, very_crit.
form:        complete, completed, incomplete, foster.
children:    1, 2, 3, more.
housing:     convenient, less_conv, critical.
finance:     convenient, inconv.
social:      nonprob, slightly_prob, problematic.
health:      recommended, priority, not_recom.
```


```{r}
nursery_data <- read.csv("http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/nursery/nursery.data", header = FALSE, col.names = c("parents","has_nurs","form","children","housing","finance","social","health","class"))

# nursery_data <- read.csv(file = "../data/nursery_data.csv")
```

## Data Set exploration and cleaning
```{r}
set.seed(77)
dim(nursery_data)
head(nursery_data)
```


# Splitting the dataset into train and test based on outcome (class)
# The Nursing dataset has the following distribution of outcome parameter:
```{r}
prop.table((table(nursery_data$class)))
```

# We are splitting the dataset in such a way, that train and test sets would have similar distribution of the 'class' attribute
```{r}
train.rows<- createDataPartition(y= nursery_data$class, p=0.9, list = FALSE)
train.data<- nursery_data[train.rows,]
prop.table((table(train.data$class)))
```
# Distribution of class depended on health
```{r}
wssplot <- function(data, nc=15, seed=1234){
  wss <- (nrow(data)-1)*sum(apply(data,2,var))
  for (i in 2:nc){
    set.seed(seed)
    wss[i] <- sum(kmeans(data, centers=i)$withinss)}
  plot(1:nc, wss, type="b", xlab="Number of Clusters",
       ylab="Within groups sum of squares")}

wssplot(train.data, nc=10) 

```
```{r  fig.height=10, fig.width=10}
is.na(train.data)
```
```{r  fig.height=10, fig.width=10}

k.means.fit <- kmeans(train.data, clusters_num,iter.max = 1000)
# attributes(k.means.fit)

# plot(k.means.fit$centers[,c("RS","ALC")])
# k.means.fit$cluster
